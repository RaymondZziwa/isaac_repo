SCI Principle Integration: Harmony in Diversity

For the website design, I applied the SCI principle of “Harmony in Diversity”, which emphasizes balance, interconnectedness, and thoughtful integration of multiple elements. This principle guided the homepage structure and content presentation. For example, in the “Our Philosophy” section, we intentionally blend diverse botanicals and proven actives to highlight EcoGlow’s commitment to sustainability and holistic wellness.

The design reflects this principle through:

- Visual balance: The text, background, and call-to-action are arranged to create a harmonious layout that is visually appealing without overwhelming the user.

- Content clarity: The copy communicates the brand’s philosophy concisely, showing how different ingredients and ideas are thoughtfully integrated.

- Purposeful structure: The section naturally guides users from learning about the brand’s SCI approach to exploring the “About” page for more details, reinforcing a seamless and intentional user journey.

By embedding this SCI principle into the website, every design choice—from color and spacing to content flow—supports the brand’s core philosophy while creating a balanced, coherent, and meaningful digital experience.
